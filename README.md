# centos7install

these are scripts I use to install Lasso & Interworx on CentOS 7. Note your lvm partitions must be prefixed with cl and xfs partitions.

Run:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcpope/centos7install/main/install1.sh | sh
```

Then reboot then run:
```
 curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcpope/centos7install/main/install2.sh | sh
 ```
